Failed to load the ESLint library for the document /home/hiroroshi/.vscode-server/extensions/eamodio.gitlens-14.9.0/dist/webviews/settings.js

To use ESLint please install eslint by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder hiroroshi
or globally using 'npm install -g eslint'. You need to reopen the workspace after installing eslint.

If you are using yarn or pnpm instead of npm set the setting `eslint.packageManager` to either `yarn` or `pnpm`
Alternatively you can disable ESLint for the workspace folder hiroroshi by executing the 'Disable ESLint' command.
[Info  - 7:41:26 PM] ESLint server stopped.
